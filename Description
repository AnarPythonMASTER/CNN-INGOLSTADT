Brief Information
We went to Ingolstadt which is located in Bayern, Germany and took multiple images of some buildings near the Catholic University of Eichstaet-Ingolstadt. Our plan is to create and deploy a model/platform which will be able to classify the images/photos taken by your phone such that the true label/name or information of the object in the photo is already predicted by our machine learning model. The categories/objects that this project is intented to be focused on are some famous buildings near the KU, namely, the following buildings:

Georganium
Entrance door of the Georganium building
The seminar room(201-203) in the Georganium
The basement room in Georgianum
The pink building in front of Georgianum
The church to the way to mensa from Georgianum
The kreuztor to the way to the main building of KU
The main entrance of the KU(x80 bus-stop)
The main building(hauptbau) of the KU from the wfi building
The WFI building from the main building of the KU
The goal and motive of the project comes from the motivation and interest to 'Deep Learning' course taught by Professor Dr. Felix Voigtlaender and Dr. Hannes Matt at Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt.

Custom Data/Image Collection
We came to Ingolstadt near the MIDS building and took images of the famous buildings which are mentioned above. We approximately took 130 images per category.

We also took into consideration the potential path of people walking nearby these buildings and potential realistic image shootings in these pathes, this is why for each category we have decided to mimic the potential walking person who is willing to scan the building by taking a photo in his/her phone of the interested object/building which he/she wants to get some information about.

Accordingly, we have started taking similar potential photos from these path ways for each category with different angles and distances.

We have in total of 2670 images

The original image dimension is 4864x3648
The image type is JPG
21 Categories with some being a subset of one big class(e.g.,'georgianum' 'georgianum 1' 'georgianum 2' 'georgianum 3')
